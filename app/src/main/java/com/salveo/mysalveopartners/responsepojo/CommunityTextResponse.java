     * Data : Admit it – social media is a part of your daily life. Currently there are over 1.5 billion monthly Facebook users. Yes, you read that correctly. Billion. With social media platforms being such a big part of the average person’s life, it only makes sense that there are social media sites for pets! Over 75% of the US population considers their pets to be family. Combine this with social media user statistics, and you have a lot of people who care about their pets and making it known online! The perfect medium for pet loving social media users? The Pet Community! The Pet Community is a social network for pet owners. It’s a place where pet parents can share photos and videos of our pets with like minded individuals…without flooding our Facebook feed (although I have no shame in this)!
